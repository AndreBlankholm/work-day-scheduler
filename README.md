# Work Day Scheduler


## User Story: As an employee with a busy schedule I would like to open my planner to add and edit important events in my daily planner ass needed.



## User expectations:  When I open my planner I want to see the current date and time above my calendar and when I Scroll down the site I am presented with blocks of time for standard business hours from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.  I would also like to see weather my time blocks were in the past present or future by color indication. When I enter an event and click the save button for that particular time block I would like to text for that event saved in local storage and then when I refresh the page I would like to see my saved info.
